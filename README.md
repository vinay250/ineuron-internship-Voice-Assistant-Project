Problem Statement:
1. A voice assistant is a digital assistant that uses voice recognition, language processing algorithms, and voice synthesis to listen to specific voice commands and return relevant information or perform specific functions as requested by the user.
2. It should be capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and other real-time information, such as news.
3. It should be able to train itself based on our live interaction with it.
4. Home Automation should be an added feature it should have.
5. You have to build the entire model from scratch.
